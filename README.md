## About.





## Documentation.





## General.





## Pros.
* Data is full typed.
* Data is compressed automatically(less CPU usage).
* Schema (defined using .proto file) is needed to generate code and read the date.
* Documentation can be embedded in the scheme.
* Data can be read across any languages (Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, C#, etc...)
* Schema can evolve over time, in a safe manner (scheme evolution)
* 3-10x smaller, 20-100x faster that XML.
* Code is generated for you automatically.





## Cons.
* Protobuf support for some languages might be lacking (but the main ones is fine)
* Can't open the serialized data with a text editor (because its compressed and serialized)
